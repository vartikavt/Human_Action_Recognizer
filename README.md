# Human_Action_Recognizer

The objective of this project is to build an application which recognizes human activities using machine learning. To recognize the activities, gathering actual human actions during daily life is the first step. We will solve this gathering issue using the smartphone. Nowadays, most people have their smartphone and the smartphones have many sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, orientation, GPS, proximity, etc. By using these sensors, we can obtain the datasets and classify the dataset using support vector machine (SVM).

=============================Pre-Requisites=============================================
1) You should have downloaded and installed the Android Studio 3.0.1 (The Official IDE for Android) in your system.
2) To use the GraphView : open source graph plotting library for Android, you can either:
   a) Include dependency: Add the below line to your 'build.gradle' file under your app directory into the dependencies block:
                                   compile 'com.jjoe64:graphview:4.2.1'
   b) Or, Download the GraphView-4.2.1.jar file from the website http://www.android-graphview.org/download-getting-started/ and copy it into the libs folder of your project.
   
3) We use Plotly Library for 3-D Data Visualization.
